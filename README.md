# etch-a-sketch

This project is about a part in the Odin Project curriculum. It can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project

With this project I want to create a field where squares are produced to make it possible to "draw".
There should be two buttons to hold for a certain action. One for drawing in the restricted field and one for erasing.

PSEUDOCODE:

1. declare a box to draw ("container")
2. it should be only possible to draw when in the box
3. the drawing should be represented by squares
4. it should be possible to delete part of the drawings when in the box and chosen "erase" button before
5. there should be a full reset button
6. there should be a slider for 16x16 grid (of the box), 32x32 and 64x64
