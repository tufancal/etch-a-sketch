# etch-a-sketch

This project is about a part in the Odin Project curriculum. It can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project

With this project I want to create a field where squares are produced to make it possible to "draw".
There should be two buttons to hold for a certain action. One for drawing in the restricted field and one for erasing.
